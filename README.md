# myFlix Client App

This project is from [CareerFoundry's Full Stack Web Development Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/) Achievement 3. This web app is built with React to utilize the [API from Achievement 2](https://github.com/dandanmania/movie_api) and display information of a few anime movies (Movies, Directors, Genres). Users will be able to register to gain access to the site, update their personal information, and create and manage a list of their favorite movies. Users can also deregister at any time.

Access the web app here:

## Created With

- React.js

## Uses

- React Bootstrap
- React Router
- React Redux
- Parcel
- PropTypes
- Sass
- Axios

### Current Issues

- Refreshing in any of the Movie, Director, Genre Views will likely only result in an error (mainly due to how the routing is set up).
- Currently there are no movie images (currently trying to figure a way to get images going, likely will try to host images somewhere and using that as a link)
